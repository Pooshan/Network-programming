Question: Implement a multi-threaded, simple web server, 207httpd, which can serve static HTML files and jpeg/gif image files. 

Answer: Multi-threading

   The server should be able to handle multiple simultaneous HTTP requests in parallel using threads. In the main thread, the server listens at a fixed port. When it receives a TCP connection request, it sets up a TCP connection socket and services the request in a separate thread. 
   web server should keep a log of incoming requests. Since separate threads are going to handle separate requests, you should synchronize logging among different threads, so that the log entries do not inter-mingled.

   Simple HTTP client: Created two section to call url. put in loop for regenerating buffer every time.

when each and every time client call or ask for access at that time server create new thread for each and every HTTP client request.
